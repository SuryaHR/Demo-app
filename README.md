# Next.js Blog
This is the main fullstack blog application of [Maximilian Schartwzmuller's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/), covered in section 11 `Complete App Example Build a Full Blog A to Z`.

i forked the project in its initial empty state and all the commits previous to [ab7af51](https://github.com/amir-mln/nextjs-blog/commit/ab7af51b18c977369e4a27e03fdf852df8aa1178) do not belong to me.
